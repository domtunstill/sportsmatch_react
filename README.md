# SportsMatch Frontend

SportsMatch encourages people to be more active by enabling them to find fellow racket sports fans to play a game with. This application serves as the frontend for our final project at Makers Academy. You can find the backend for our project [here](https://github.com/jessmar94/sportsmatch_api).

## Additional Features
If we had more time, we would have looked to implement the following features:
- Ability to submit the score of the game.
- Ability to register with multiple sports, rather than picking just one.
- Ability for player to input their availability for other players to see - this would require creating an Availability table.
- Ability to register the result of a game as a draw.
- Add in a weather API to help players pick the best day to play.
